  "readme": "sane\n----\n\nI've been driven to insanity by node filesystem watcher wrappers.\nSane aims to be fast, small, and reliable file system watcher. It does that by:\n\n* Always use fs.watch (unless polling is forced) and sensibly workaround the various issues with it\n* Sane is all JavaScript, no native components\n* Stay away from polling because it's very slow and cpu intensive\n* Support polling for environments like Vagrant shared directory where there are no native filesystem events\n\n## Install\n\nRequires node >= v0.10.0.\n\n```\n$ npm install sane\n```\n\n## API\n\n### sane(dir, globs, options)\n\nWatches a directory and all it's descendant directorys for changes, deletions, and additions on files and directories.\nShortcut for `new sane.Watcher(dir, {glob: globs, ..options})`.\n\n```js\nvar watcher = sane('path/to/dir', ['**/*.js, '**/*.css']);\nwatcher.on('ready', function () { console.log('ready') });\nwatcher.on('change', function (filepath) { console.log('file changed', filepath); });\nwatcher.on('add', function (filepath) { console.log('file added', filepath); });\nwatcher.on('delete', function (filepath) { console.log('file deleted', filepath); });\n// close\nwatcher.close();\n```\n\nFor `options` see `sane.Watcher`.\n\n### sane.Watcher(dir, options)\n\noptions:\n\n* `persistent`: boolean indicating that the process shouldn't die while we're watching files.\n* `glob`: a single string glob pattern or an array of them.\n* `poll`: puts the watcher in polling mode. Under the hood that means `fs.watchFile`.\n* `interval`: indicates how often the files should be polled. (passed to `fs.watchFile`)\n\nFor the glob pattern documentation, see [minimatch](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch).\n\n### sane.Watcher#close\n\nStops watching.\n\n### sane.Watcher events\n\nEmits the following events:\n\nAll events are passed the file/dir path relative to the root directory\n* `ready` when the program is ready to detect events in the directory\n* `change` when a file changes\n* `add` when a file or directory has been added\n* `delete` when a file or directory has been deleted\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n",
